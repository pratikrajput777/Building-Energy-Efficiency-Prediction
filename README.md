 # 🏠 Building Energy Efficiency Prediction 

This project aims to predict **Heating Load** and **Cooling Load** of residential buildings based on architectural and design parameters using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to contribute to **sustainability** and **energy efficiency** by enabling data-driven insights during the early stages of building design.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Energy consumption in buildings is a major contributor to global energy demand and emissions. By predicting the heating and cooling loads using design features (e.g. compactness, wall area, glazing), we can:

- Improve building energy efficiency
- Guide architects and engineers in sustainable design
- Reduce environmental impact from the construction industry
